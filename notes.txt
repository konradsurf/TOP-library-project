NEXT SESSION
[x] create github repo and push it
[x] dynamic adjustment of column quantity
	[x] set widths/heights for each card to make this work? Maybe the clamp method? Or minmax?
[x] style form and button
[x] address how to get title to wrap if too long - used overflow auto instead - keep height of cards consistent this way
[ ] import roboto font
[ ] README file

	



STILL NEED
[x] build out rest of form
[x] have it feed title, author, pages and read? to the addBookToLibrary function
[x] clear values from input boxes once book added
[x] has been read checkbox doesn't seem to be passing through to new book object


[x] add logic to clear out the current <p>'s/cards in the list when re-displaying books in displayBooks() function. 
	- add class to all p's in the displayBooks function - DONE
	- use query selector all to get nodelist - DONE
	- foreach through nodelist 


[x] add index to to all p's in the displayBooks function
[x] change booklist <p>'s into divs - they should be the ones indexed.  
[x] put title, author, etc in separate <p>'s nested in the div
[x] style booklist <div>'s into cards (have it in separate elements, 	
	[x] to grid place book info, add class in JS to each P element (author, title etc)
	[x] then add p element to label each field (or maybe a label element?) - give it same class if label (author 		title etc), different class if a <p>element;
	
	
[x] delete button to remove books - use the index "id" and delete all of it's child elements as well. 
	-- removeBook() is working.  Just need event listener on each of those buttons. Perhaps one listener for all delete-btn class buttons, uses id of the button pushed to pass to removeBook()? 
	[x] does event listener need to be "refreshed" every time we add/delete a card? - if so, put it in the display books function? 


[x] button to change read status - To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a bookâ€™s read 	status on your Book prototype instance.
	[x] it's updating the object in the myLibrary array but not updating it in UI (even though the displayBooks() function is firing (and it seems to be recreating the divs and p's). --- SEEMS LIKE THE readStatus function is maintaining its state of "has been read" or "not read yet" even though Book.read[i] is updating.  -- wasn't using 'this' in front of the "read" property within the "readStatus" method (in the constructor). 


[x] validation on submit so that new card with blank data or partial data is not created (make sure all boxes filled out before creating a new book record.
[x] can I/ should I consolidate the displayBooks and displayBookInList functions? - nah, b/c displayBooks is for all Book objects, displayBookInList is for each individual Book instance.
[x] dynamically change read button text/color when it's pressed and status changed? (does this make the read status line unnecessary? - probably not - b/c button would say "change it to read" or something like that) - not needed b/s status changes on the card
[x] remove dummy records? - or keep?  Nope, nice to start user off with something

TO CONSIDER LATER
